# Healthcare Analytics Visualizations (HA-Visuals)

**Overview:** This repository contains a Python script showcasing 25+ healthcare analytics visualizations using simulated hospital data. The visualizations cover patient demographics, revenue trends, LOS (length of stay), and other key metrics — designed for learning, exploration, and visual storytelling in healthcare analytics.


## Highlights / Key Plots
- **Violin plots** → patient distributions & density  
- **Radial bar plots** → monthly patient volumes  
- **3D scatter plots** → age, LOS & cost relationships  
- **Contour plots** → density patterns across variables  
- **Hexbin plots** → clustering and high-density areas  
- **Step & stack plots** → revenue & patient trends over time  
- **Population pyramids** → age & gender distribution
 
*All plots are generated with simulated data for demonstration purposes.*  


## Why this matters in HA
- Identify busiest months & departments  
- Spot revenue & patient growth trends  
- Optimize resources, staffing, and workflow  
- Make data-driven decisions visually intuitive


## Tools / Libraries Used
- Python   
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib


## Notes
Data is **simulated** to demonstrate visualization techniques; you can replace it with real hospital data. Each plot includes **comments explaining its interpretation and HA use case**.
